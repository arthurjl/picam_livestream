# picam_livestream

Streams live video from a raspberry pi to a web browser. Uses cloud service (free dyno on heroku) to allow you to view the live stream from anywhere without having to change your home network settings.

Streaming uses jsmpeg (https://github.com/phoboslab/jsmpeg) and the ws_relay concept to be able to view the live stream on a cloud-hosted site.

More detailed instructions to come.
